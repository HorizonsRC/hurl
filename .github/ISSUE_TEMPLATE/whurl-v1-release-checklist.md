## Alpha Release Notes

This 0.1.0 alpha release focuses on core functionality for use as a dependency in other environmental data projects. The following design decisions were made for this alpha:

### ‚úÖ Alpha Release Scope
- **Target Users**: Fellow developers and environmental data teams
- **Primary Use Case**: Library dependency for other projects
- **Fixture Cache**: Intentionally empty for security (real server responses may contain sensitive data)
- **API Coverage**: Current endpoints sufficient for initial use cases
- **Testing**: Comprehensive offline testing with graceful handling of missing fixtures

### üöÄ Alpha Release Blockers (Minimal)

**Critical Issues for Alpha Release:**

1. **SSL Verification Configuration**: Current client disables SSL verification for testing
   - **Impact**: Should be configurable for library users
   - **Solution**: Make SSL verification configurable with clear documentation
   - **Owner**: @nicmostert

2. **Package Dependency Documentation**: Missing guidance for integration into other projects
   - **Impact**: Users may not understand how to use as dependency
   - **Solution**: Create dependency usage guide with environment configuration examples
   - **Owner**: @nicmostert

**Non-Critical for Alpha (Future Enhancements):**
- Fixture cache population (handled by individual developers using `--update`)
- Additional API endpoints (planned for future releases)
- Production deployment guides (not applicable for library dependencies)

## Testing Strategy

### Before Release
```bash
# All tests must pass in these scenarios:

# 1. Unit tests (offline, fast)
poetry run python -m pytest tests/ --mode=unit

# 2. Integration tests (with populated fixtures)
poetry run python -m pytest tests/ --mode=integration

# 3. Performance tests (validate HTTP optimizations)
poetry run python -m pytest tests/performance/ --performance-local

# 4. End-to-end validation against live API
poetry run python -m pytest tests/ --mode=integration --update
```

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 90% code coverage for `whurl/` package

3. **Complete documentation** for all public APIs
4. **Security review** completed with no critical issues
5. **Performance benchmarks** meet established criteria
6. **Installation testing** successful on major platforms

### Post-Release Success Metrics
1. **Successful installations** from PyPI without issues
2. **User adoption** within environmental data community
3. **Issue resolution** within reasonable timeframes

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Fixture cache population**: Requires access to live Hilltop servers
- **SSL verification**: May break existing test configurations
- **API compatibility**: Changes may affect existing users

### Medium Risk
- **Performance regressions**: HTTP optimizations may introduce bugs
- **Documentation gaps**: Missing docs may lead to user confusion
- **Dependency conflicts**: Package versions may conflict with user environments

### Low Risk
- **PyPI deployment**: Well-established process with test environment
- **Version management**: Standard semantic versioning approach
