## Release Blockers

### Critical Issues That Must Be Resolved

1. **Missing Fixture Cache Data**: Integration tests fail because `tests/fixture_cache/` directories are empty
   - **Impact**: Cannot validate XML parsing against real API responses
   - **Solution**: Populate cache with responses from live Hilltop servers
   - **Owner**: @nicmostert

2. **SSL Verification Disabled**: Current client disables SSL verification
   - **Impact**: Security risk in production environments
   - **Solution**: Enable SSL verification with proper certificate handling
   - **Owner**: @nicmostert

3. **Incomplete API Coverage**: Missing several endpoint types
   - **Impact**: Limited functionality compared to full Hilltop API
   - **Solution**: Implement remaining endpoints or document limitations
   - **Owner**: @nicmostert

4. **Production Configuration**: No guidance for production deployment
   - **Impact**: Users may deploy with insecure configurations
   - **Solution**: Create production deployment guide
   - **Owner**: @nicmostert

## Testing Strategy

### Before Release
```bash
# All tests must pass in these scenarios:

# 1. Unit tests (offline, fast)
poetry run python -m pytest tests/ --mode=unit

# 2. Integration tests (with populated fixtures)
poetry run python -m pytest tests/ --mode=integration

# 3. Performance tests (validate HTTP optimizations)
poetry run python -m pytest tests/performance/ --performance-local

# 4. End-to-end validation against live API
poetry run python -m pytest tests/ --mode=integration --update
```

### Coverage Requirements
